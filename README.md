This is a project site that i made to practice my react skills. 

It uses firebase on the back-end to handle authentication with email/password.
Firebase is also used to track a users orders, as well as update the menu. 
The menu can be altered on the back-end, and in real time it will update. 
In a way this could be used as a type of CMS where the owner of the shop could update product descriptions, titles and prices without anyone having to touch the code. 
Once logged in, a user can see his/her previous order history. 
This project also uses GSAP ScrollTrigger to render animations based on a users scroll position. 
There is a floating navigation to help the user scroll through the history pages quickly, and highlights the current location. 
The Project uses Reacts Context-Api to help manage state throughout the app.
